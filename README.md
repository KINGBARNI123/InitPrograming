  <h1>HISTORY</h1>
  
  <p1>The relationship between writers and publishers can be used to describe the concept of online development. After finalizing their novels, authors would submit them to publishing houses for printing. The book's title, subtitles, and many other details would be included in this print, which would follow a conventional or general format. This is comparable to HTML and other markup languages because they too offered our code structure and titles but not particularity. After a while, authors wanted their novels to stand out from the competition, so they began providing publishers with alternative style guides. The size or boldness of their text would be listed on this sheet. This may be connected to CSS's goal. CSS(cascading style sheets) is used by developers to give their website a unique and contrasted look.</p1>
